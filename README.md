# 🏦 Simple Banking System

Welcome to the **Simple Banking System** — a C# console application designed to demonstrate basic banking operations like checking balance, deposits, and withdrawals with simple authentication using a PIN. This beginner-friendly project is great for practicing conditionals, loops, and basic object-free procedural C# programming.


## 🚀 Features

🔐 **PIN Authentication**: Secure access using a simple numeric PIN
💰 **Deposit Funds**: Add money to your account safely
🏧 **Withdraw Funds**: Withdraw cash with balance checks
📊 **Balance Inquiry**: View current balance with proper formatting
🧭 **Menu Navigation**: Simple, clear console UI for smooth user experience
🚫 **Input Validation**: Handles invalid inputs gracefully

1. On running the program, you're prompted to enter a PIN.
2. Once verified, you’ll be presented with a menu:

   * Check Balance
   * Deposit
   * Withdraw
   * Exit
3. All actions affect a fixed account initialized with:

   * **Name**: Mehul Kumar
   * **Account Number**: `123456789`
   * **PIN**: `1234`
   * **Initial Balance**: `$5000.00`


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Visual Studio / VS Code**: Recommended IDEs for editing and running

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.
2. Save the code in a file named `Program.cs`
3. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
dotnet new console -n SimpleBank
cd SimpleBank
# Replace auto-generated Program.cs with your code
